<p>
    Our acknowledgement of the difficulties regarding finding affordable parking
    spaces in large cities brought our efforts towards the creation of this
    application. We believe that giving our communities the opportunity to help
    each other with the incentive of a small monetary gains would only ease the
    lives of those who wish or need to travel to large cities. EParking will
    allow it's users to rent or lease private parking spaces to the public for a
    fee equal to or smaller than those offered through public means. The money
    gained from this application will distributed three ways: the owner, the
    developers, and the government as we do not wish to take away from the
    city's profits on parking meters. Our mission is to make the lives of
    commuters and travelers easier and more affordable while also engaging our
    community.
