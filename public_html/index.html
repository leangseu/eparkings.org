                        Our acknowledgement of the difficulties regarding finding affordable parking
                        spaces in large cities brought our efforts towards the creation of this
                        application. We believe that giving our communities the opportunity to help
                        each other with the incentive of a small monetary gains would only ease the
                        lives of those who wish or need to travel to large cities. EParking will
                        allow it's users to rent or lease private parking spaces to the public for a
                        fee equal to or smaller than those offered through public means. The money
                        gained from this application will distributed three ways: the owner, the
                        developers, and the government as we do not wish to take away from the
